model,winrate (100 games), CI (95% 1000 samples), notes
Skip Old R, 0.009, (3.15x$10^{-3}$,1.48x$10^{-2}$), Prioritizes jump punching with occasional hadoken at range. 
No Skip Old R, 0.048, (3.48x$10^{-2}$, 6.12x$10^{-2}$), Learned basic combo of light punch shoryoken, also would launch hadukens at the opponent once knocked back
                    Defensively blocked occasionaly, would sometimes counter oppoennt jump attack with its own or shoryuken. Would jump back to dodge

Skip DQN, 0.023, (1.37x$10^{-2}$, 3.23x$10^{-2}$), similar results to
No Skip DQN, 0.025,(1.53x$10^{-2}$, 3.47x$10^{-2}$), Doesn't have as good defensive options, over chooses aggression
