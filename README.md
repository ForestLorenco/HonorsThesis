# HonorsThesis
These are the files for my honors thesis.

Description:
Gaming has changed drastically from it conception. It has evolved from 8 bit arcade cabinets to massive open worlds on home 
consoles and tablets. Modern game development has allowed for more complex and sophisticated systems. As gaming has progressed,
gamers now expect top level graphics, interesting gameplay, and intelligent human-like game artificial intelligence when 
purchasing a game. Developing “human-acting” artificial intelligence is paramount in order to continue to innovate and keep 
players attention as games already have lifelike graphics and gameplay. 

One thing to keep in mind is that gamers do not want unbeatable artificial intelligence as it makes games stale and boring and 
defeats any incentive to play.  In order to create this artificial intelligence it makes sense to try and teach the computer 
through past actions, similar to how human players learn to master games. Another possible method would be a learning algorithm
that seeks to emulate the opposing player. This would allow for you to train a personal fighter that acts like you and could 
also have useful applications in the e-sports world.  

##File Setup
In the repository you will find the two folders. One containing several
implementations for Deep Q Learning with replay memory and one 
containing an implementation for Asynchronous one-step DQL.
